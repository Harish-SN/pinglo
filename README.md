# Pinglo 🟢

Pinglo is a **minimal, LAN-first chat application** built for private networks.

It lets people on the **same local network** join a room and chat instantly —  
no accounts, no cloud, no external dependencies.

Designed to be:
- simple
- fast
- private
- easy to run anywhere

---

## ✨ What Pinglo Is

- A **local chat tool** for offices, labs, hostels, classrooms, or home networks

---

## 🚫 What Pinglo Is *Not*
